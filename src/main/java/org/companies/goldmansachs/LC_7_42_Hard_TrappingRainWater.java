 * @description:
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
 * In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
 * Output: 9
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == height.length
 * 0 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
 *
